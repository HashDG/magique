To compile these examples, follow the next steps:

	1) Be sure that the RAGE package was compiled:

		$ ls RAGE_HOME/lib
		rage.jar

	If there is no file in this directory, go to the RAGE_HOME/src 
	directory and see the README file to compile the RAGE package.

	2) Go in the directory you wish and simply type make

		$ make
		... (please wait)
		
	3) See the README file in the directory for specific warnings 
	and enjoy ...

NOTE: The file hierarchy can be used to built a simply Rage agents hierarchy 
      on a single machine.
